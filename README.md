# Project description.

The main goal of this project is to analyse a huge amount of reviews from different movies to extract the main features that people want to find when looking for a movie.

# Steps:

* We will get the **movielens dataset**, clean it and profile its features.
* Once cleaned we will apply clustering algorithms to clasiffy the different movies we are going to find on it.
* Review data will be enriched with user's information.
* Clusters will be analyzed to profile what kind of movies are the people's favourite.
* Finally there will be a prediction of the rating of new incoming movies, based on its features.
